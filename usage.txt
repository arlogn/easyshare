### Usage/Info ###



# Getting started
  ---------------
  Once installed the addon enter the URL of your Diaspora pod in its Preferences.


# Start sharing
  -------------
  Use the right-click context menu over images and/or selected text.
  Do the same within any Youtube video page to share videos.


# Text formatting
  ---------------
  Use the buttons in the right section to add a basic formatting to the entered text.
  You can add html tags for emphasis, strong emphasis or to define an indented quoted
  section, to the entire text or by selecting part of it.


# URL shortening
  --------------
  With version 0.9.0 Easyshare stops using ApiKey authentication to access the Bitly API
  and switches to OAuth2. Now to shorten URLs you must authorize the addon on your private
  Bitly account to receive an OAuth access token. The token is stored (hidden) in the preferences
  and allows Easyshare to access the Bilty API on your behalf. You can perform the authorization
  flow using the dedicated button in the preferences.


# Preferences
  -----------
  Pod Url: URL of diaspora pod where you want to share. (REQUIRED)
  Publisher Width/Height: set the size of the publisher popup window.
  Bitly OAuth Web Flow: button to start the authorization process. (Required to shorten URLs)

# Versions
  --------
  On AMO (addons.mozilla.org): 0.8.2 (OLD)

  Current: 0.9.1 (this file refers to this version, waiting for review on AMO)
  https://github.com/arlogn/easyshare/blob/master/d_easyshare.0.9.1.xpi?raw=true

  In progress: 0.10.1
  This version introduce a new diaspora module to create a diaspora session, post a status
  message and get some user data. It stops using the publisher bookmarklet.
  Relevant differences are:
  1) a new button in the preferences to enter the pod credentials.
  Credentials are stored in the Firefox Password Manager and identified with this string:
  'addon:jid1-gqfeTXcouyVkpg (Pod credentials for Easyshare)'.
  You can manage them opening 'about:preferences#security' and clicking on 'Saved passwords'.
  2) new input box in the panel to enter how to share the post. Here you can enter:
  - public : to share public (you can also leave the box blank to share public)
  - all_aspects : to share with all your aspects
  - aspect-name : to share with a single aspect entering its name

  ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TEST THIS VERSION IS WELCOME!
